# Bartavelles description : 
Chalet Les Bartavelles is a hidden gem; nestled in the trees just off the Route des Chalets, located next to the Doron (blue) piste just above the centre of Méribel. As well as being perfectly positioned to enable you to ski in and ski out with ease, you are within a few minutes ski of Méribel’s main lift centre and ski school meeting points. For evenings out with friends, it’s just a short distance from the centre of Meribel. As is standard for Purple Ski, you have your own private chauffeur to whisk you back and forth in the comfort of a luxury 4x4 minibus.

Bartavelles sleeps 10 adults in 5 en-suite bedrooms, and can accommodate another 4 children, 2 in a "loft" bedroom (suitable only for older children) and 2 in the lower bedrooms. This beautiful chalet has been decorated with great care and individuality. Its spacious living and dining spaces combine spectacular views and supreme comfort. The south facing picture windows open onto a sun terrace and for ultimate rejuvenation, the outdoor hot tub beckons aching muscles.
