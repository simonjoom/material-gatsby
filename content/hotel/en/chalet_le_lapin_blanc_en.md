# Hotel's description
Ski in ski out. Located on the side of the Georges Mauduit piste at the end of a private road opposite La Chaudanne – the lift centre of Méribel.

Nestled in the heart of Méribel, this ski-in, ski-out chalet is one of the most luxurious and best located in the valley.

Magnificent from the outside in, this striking chalet spans four floors and is flanked by sundrenched wraparound balconies, which boast enviable views of the Tougnette side of the mountain.
Sumptuously furnished throughout with local wood and stone and peppered with British and French aesthetic, this luxurious home from home balances spacious alpine style with much-needed comfort, making it an ideal retreat after a long day on the slopes.

The chale has to be its enormous sitting and dining room, which with its central open log fire strikes a dramatic first impression. The dining area easily accommodates 14 people and because the sitting room opens to the mezzanine above, the sense of space is remarkable.
For that well-deserved glass of champagne, the south facing picture windows open onto a sun terrace, and for ultimate rejuvenation, the outdoor hot tub beckons aching muscles.
