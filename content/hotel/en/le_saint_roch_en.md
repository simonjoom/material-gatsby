<!-- # Description: -->
The Saint Roch is the last born of Eric Tournier and NoÃ«lle Bonnemaison. With this hotel *****, the duo erects the act of receiving the rank of art. A French way of life, pushed to its climax, which blends with happiness, modernity and conviviality, luxury and relaxation, in a privileged environment where the mountain spirit reigns.
