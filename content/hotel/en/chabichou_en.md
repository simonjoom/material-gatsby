A gastronomy that resonates through dishes subtly concocted by four hands by Michel Rochedy (Master Chef of France) and St√©phane Buron
An invitation to savor their inventive, refined and generous cuisine, made with fresh and natural products.
Throughout the seasons, in an enchanting setting, Maryse Rochedy warmly welcomes you. The ballet of an attentive and discreet service has been a hallmark of gastronomy honored by two macaroons since 1984.
The terrace of Chabichou is open every lunchtime, accessible by ski (slalom stadium), snowshoe or cross-country skiing (squirrels way) and on foot and by car (Chenus district). Possibility of parking.
