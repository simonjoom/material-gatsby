Djola means «little brother» in Tibetan and, drawing on the style of its older «brothers», Le K2 Palace and Le K2 Altitude, Le K2 Djola as a concept will not disappoint."

<!-- # K2 Djola's description -->
“The love of a family, the centre around which everything revolves, and
everything shines.” Victor Hugo could, without doubt, have written these words for Le K2 Collections. To this flamboyant constellation, a new star has been added. The newest member of our family, Le K2 Djola is perfectly in keeping with his elder brothers. A 4-star boutique-hotel, in the image of Le K2 Palace and the K2 Altitude. A cocoon that claims its own identity, based on luxury and simplicity. 
A project we put our heart and soul into.
With the involvement of our son Thomas, this project takes on a family dimension. More than ever, throughout this new haven, we are passionate about satisfying young and old. An opportunity for us to express the very essence of Le K2 Collections spirit.
 And much more besides: dedicated to the art of pâtisserie, the SarKara restaurant has opened in Le K2 Palace; and you can now enjoy Valmont products and treatments in our Goji Spas. So much happening that embodies excellence in hotelier savoir faire.
We hope you enjoy your stay with us. And welcome to Courchevel.
