### Julie's Description
Julie is a competent ski instructor, she was working with ESF 1650. She speaks fluently english, skiscool worked with her many time and his customers was everytimes satisfied of their journey with her.

Snowboard World champion, I began to ski at the age of 18 months in Meribel.  
I was lucky to grow up in 3 Valleys which I know by heart. I above all like sliding, doing pizza or going fast, on the green or black tracks ...  
I like sharing my passion with the largest number. In ski or in snowboard, beginners to experts, the children or the adults, on tracks or in off-piste skiing, ski touring, my pleasure is to see your smile and enjoying your time on the snow!!!
