<p>Culminating at 2,738 metres, the majestic Saulire is the highest point in the Courchevel Valley ski area.

<p>And what’s more, after 5pm, it’s free to get up to the top…</p>

<p>Two other areas reserved for younger children are also located at the top of the Tovets chair lift, next to the top of the toboggan run.</p>

<div class="pl2 rich-text">
<p>Created in 1961 by Michel Ziegler, former mayor of Courchevel and mountain and aviation enthusiast, Courchevel’s Altiport has played a key role in the resort’s history. At an altitude of 2,007 metres, it was the first mountain aerodrome to have an upslope runway and is the only altiport to be kept clear of snow all year round. With the use of helicopters becoming increasingly popular, the heliport has expanded to accommodate them even more comfortably and safely.</p>

<p>Accessible via an easy run, it’s the ideal place to enjoy panoramic views over Mont Blanc or La Grande Casse… and to admire the impressive sight of planes taking off!</p>

<p>A few figures:</p>

<ul>
	<li>537 metres: length of run</li>
	<li>18.66%: maximum slope, the highest gradient in the world!</li>
	<li>6,000 flight turnarounds every winter</li>

<p>Definitely the most noteworthy part of the 1992 Olympic Games legacy, the ski jumps in Le Praz are home to an exhibition on the history of the site and the sport. To begin with, there were two ski jumps, measuring 90 metres and 120 metres, the latter being to this day the only one of its kind in France. Then came the 60 metre and 25 metre jumps, completing the most extensive, best-equipped collection of ski jumps in the country. French and international teams carry out their ski jump training at the Maison des Sauteurs and the Envolée Gymnasium, whilst the Sports Club invites budding champions to make their first jumps from the age of 6-7.</p>

<p>Every summer, the area becomes the stage of the world ski jumping championships (attracting more than 8 000 spectators), with numerous competitions taking place there throughout the year.</p>
